If you are wondering whether 1971 is worth watching, you might be interested in reading some of the reviews from critics and audiences. The movie has received mostly positive feedback for its gripping portrayal of a daring and historic operation that exposed the FBI's illegal activities and helped spark the Watergate scandal.
 
According to Rotten Tomatoes, the movie has a 97% approval rating based on 31 reviews, with an average score of 7.6/10. The critics consensus states: "Illuminating a chapter of America's past that ties directly into current events, 1971 persuasively demonstrates that those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it."[^1^]
 
Some of the critics praised the movie for its suspenseful and humorous tone, its effective use of dramatic re-enactments and archival footage, and its relevance to the present-day issues of surveillance and whistleblowing. For example, Robert Lloyd of Los Angeles Times wrote: "In her recounting, a strange and lively atmosphere of outrage, enthusiasm and paranoia, Hamilton has made of her tale a kind of real-life, old-fashioned analog caper film."[^1^]
 
The movie also received a 78% audience score based on more than 500 ratings on Rotten Tomatoes. Many viewers expressed their admiration for the courage and conviction of the burglars, who risked their freedom and safety to expose the truth. Some also commented on how the movie made them more aware of the history and impact of the FBI's actions on civil rights and social movements.
 
However, not everyone was impressed by the movie. Some critics felt that the movie was too slow-paced, too biased, or too superficial in its exploration of the complex issues involved. For example, Norman Wilner of NOW Toronto wrote: "Johanna Hamilton's 1971 may not be as dynamic or immediate a documentary as executive producer Laura Poitras's Citizenfour, but as a look at the earliest iteration of America as a security state, it's essential."[^2^]
