Cm93 Ed 2 Charts are updated periodically by C-MAP, and the latest version available is from January 2013[^1^]. However, some users may prefer to use older versions of Cm93 Ed 2 Charts, as they may contain more accurate or detailed information for some regions[^4^]. Cm93 Ed 2 Charts can be obtained from various sources on the internet, but some of them may be illegal or unreliable[^3^]. Therefore, users should exercise caution and discretion when downloading or using Cm93 Ed 2 Charts.
 
Cm93 Ed 2 Charts are not intended to replace official charts or publications issued by national hydrographic offices or other competent authorities. Users should always consult the latest official charts and notices to mariners before undertaking any voyage. Users should also be aware of the limitations and inaccuracies of Cm93 Ed 2 Charts, such as outdated or missing data, incorrect positions or depths, or lack of coverage for some areas[^5^]. Users should always use their own judgment and common sense when navigating with Cm93 Ed 2 Charts, and never rely solely on them.
  
Cm93 Ed 2 Charts are divided into cells, which are files that contain the chart data for a specific area. The cells are organized into six levels of scale, from A to F, with A being the smallest and F being the largest. The cell file name is related to the cell's area of coverage and scale level. For example, the cell file name C1234567.D is composed of four parts: C indicates the scale level (C level is medium scale), 12 indicates the latitude band (12 degrees north), 3456 indicates the longitude band (3456 minutes east), and D indicates the cell type (D stands for depth).
 
Cm93 Ed 2 Charts can be customized by the user according to their preferences and needs. For example, the user can choose which layers of information to display or hide, such as coastlines, soundings, lights, buoys, landmarks, etc. The user can also adjust the colors, symbols, fonts, and units of the charts. The user can also create their own objects or annotations on the charts, such as marks, routes, tracks, notes, etc. The user can also import or export data from other sources or formats, such as GPX, KML, CSV, etc.
 
Cm93 Ed 2 Charts are compatible with other types of charts that use the S57 format, such as ENC (Electronic Navigational Chart) or IENC (Inland Electronic Navigational Chart). ENC and IENC are official vector charts that are produced and authorized by national hydrographic offices or other competent authorities. They are designed to meet the requirements of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) for safe navigation. ENC and IENC are usually more accurate and up-to-date than Cm93 Ed 2 Charts, but they may not cover all areas or provide all details that Cm93 Ed 2 Charts do.
