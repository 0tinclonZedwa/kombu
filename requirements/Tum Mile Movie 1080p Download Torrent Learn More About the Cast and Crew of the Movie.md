## Tum Mile Movie Review: What Critics and Audiences Say
 
Tum Mile received mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike. Some praised the film for its realistic portrayal of the Mumbai floods and the chemistry between the lead actors, while others criticized it for its weak script, slow pace and lack of tension.
 
According to Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 5.0/10 based on 2 reviews. Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India gave the film 3.5/5 stars and wrote, "What really stands out in the film is the acting. Emraan and Soha create a chemistry that is brimming over with warmth and remains quite unpredictable till the very end." Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 2/5 stars and wrote, "That lack of tension tells on the film: the effective parts when the two [Emraan Hashmi and Soha Ali Khan] are coming together and drawing apart get submerged by the way it wraps."
 
According to IMDb, the film has a rating of 4.8/10 based on 1,308 votes. Some users praised the film for its emotional appeal and music, while others complained about its clichÃ©d plot and poor direction. One user wrote, "I had thought I was consciously going from one disaster flick to another, from the latest that Hollywood has to offer, to what Bollywood has on its plate... but this was actually quite the disastrous picture in itself." Another user wrote, "Movie: Tum Mile Rating: 1.5/5 I generally don't watch films of Emraan Hashmi since they have often an A certificate and don't suit for family viewing. But since this film Tum Mile had a UA Certification, I decided to watch it. I found the film interesting in parts, but I didn't find a reason to love the film."
 
Tum Mile is a movie that may not appeal to everyone's taste. It is a movie that tries to blend romance and disaster in an unconventional way. It is a movie that has its moments of charm and drama, but also its flaws and drawbacks. It is a movie that you may like or dislike depending on your expectations and preferences.
